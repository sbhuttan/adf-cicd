# Sample YAML file to validate and export an ARM template into a build artifact
# Requires a package.json file located in the target repository

trigger:
- main #collaboration branch

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:

# Installs Node and the npm packages saved in your package.json file in the build

- task: UseNode@1
  inputs:
    version: '18.x'
  displayName: 'Install Node.js'

- task: Npm@1
  inputs:
    command: 'install'
    workingDir: '$(Build.Repository.LocalPath)/build' #replace with the package.json folder
    verbose: true
  displayName: 'Install npm package'

# Validates all of the Data Factory resources in the repository. You'll get the same validation errors as when "Validate All" is selected.
# Enter the appropriate subscription and name for the source factory. Either of the "Validate" or "Validate and Generate ARM template" options are required to perform validation. Running both is unnecessary.

- task: Npm@1
  inputs:
    command: 'custom'

  displayName: 'Validate'

# Validate and then generate the ARM template into the destination folder, which is the same as selecting "Publish" from the UX.
# The ARM template generated isn't published to the live version of the factory. Deployment should be done by using a CI/CD pipeline.
